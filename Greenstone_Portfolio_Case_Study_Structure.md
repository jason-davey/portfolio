### BLOCK 2: THE INNOVATION METHODOLOGY

**Headline**: "3 Concepts in 3 Weeks" - A New Paradigm for Enterprise Innovation

**Content**:

I developed a revolutionary rapid discovery methodology that integrated generative AI tools with collaborative design thinking practices, enabling cross-functional teams to compress traditional multi-month development cycles into sprint-length iterations.

**The Methodology Components**:

**1. AI+UX Innovation Practice Foundation**
Before launching rapid prototyping initiatives, I established the organizational infrastructure for sustainable AI adoption:
- Platform-agnostic AI principles and governance frameworks
- TypeScript development standards with AWS deployment configurations
- Quality assurance protocols ensuring production-ready outputs
- Ethical AI guidelines maintaining human-centered design rigor

**2. Collaborative Workshop Framework**
I designed a structured 90-minute workshop format that leveraged AI tools as collaborative partners rather than replacement tools:

**Phase 1: Discovery & Synthesis (30 minutes)**
- Pre-workshop: Process flow analysis and current-state documentation in Miro
- Workshop: Cross-functional team (Product Owners, Designers, Stakeholders) collaboratively identifies pain points, user needs, and solution requirements
- AI Synthesis: Miro AI categorizes inputs, identifies patterns, generates questions for deeper exploration

**Phase 2: Prompt Engineering (30 minutes)**
- Team validates and refines AI-synthesized insights
- Collaborative prompt crafting in ChatGPT, translating business requirements into structured development brief
- AI generates detailed design specification including:
  - Design goals and success criteria
  - User workflows and task models
  - Functional requirements by module
  - Business value articulation
  - Technical considerations

**Phase 3: Rapid Prototyping (30 minutes)**
- Structured prompt input into v0.dev (AI-powered UI development platform)
- Real-time prototype generation with functional components
- Team review and immediate iteration planning
- Documentation capture for development handoff

**The Results**
This methodology delivered three enterprise-grade CRM prototypes in a 21-day sprint—demonstrating a **10x acceleration** in concept-to-prototype timelines compared to traditional approaches.

### BLOCK 3: PROJECT EV2 - CASE STUDY DEEP DIVE

**Headline**: From Business Problem to Functional Prototype in 90 Minutes

**Content**:

**The Challenge**
Greenstone's existing sales platform (Evolve) created cognitive overload for agents managing complex customer journeys across multiple insurance products. Product Owners Katrina Foster and Rebecca Hayward identified critical gaps but lacked rapid visualization tools to communicate improvement opportunities to technology teams.

**The Big Question**
"Can we build the next version of Evolve using AI-enabled rapid prototyping?"

**The Workshop Approach**
I facilitated a single 90-minute collaborative session with the Product Owner team:

**Preparation (60 minutes pre-workshop)**
- Collated existing process flows for Direct Life insurance products (AU Seniors, Real Insurance)
- Documented current-state task models and agent pain points in Miro
- Established workshop objectives and success criteria

**Live Workshop Session (90 minutes)**
- **Minutes 0-10**: Scene setting, objectives clarification, participant role alignment
- **Minutes 10-20**: Team collaboratively drafted task lists, job requirements, and scope summaries with Miro AI synthesis support
- **Minutes 20-30**: Input capture and prompt engineering in ChatGPT to structure detailed UI development brief
- **Minutes 30-40**: v0.dev prototype generation from AI-structured prompt
- **Minutes 40-90**: Team review, iteration planning, documentation capture

**The Prototype Output**
In 10 minutes of AI interaction (within the 90-minute workshop), v0.dev generated a functional CRM interface with four comprehensive modules:

1. **Customer Profile Management**: Search functionality, policy holder status, payment processing integration
2. **Lead Management Dashboard**: Telephony integration, email contact components, agent assignment workflows, inline notes functionality
3. **Payments Processing**: Payment dashboard, overdue account management, payment arrangement tools
4. **Policy Management**: Policy type overview, coverage adjustment tools, state transition workflows, quote management

**The Impact**
- **Time Compression**: 90-minute workshop replacing 60-90 day traditional discovery cycle
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Real-time collaboration ensuring shared understanding and buy-in
- **Quality Maintenance**: Enterprise-grade functional prototype suitable for development handoff
- **Change Management**: Visual "Art of the Possible" demonstration accelerating organizational AI adoption

**Visual Recommendations**:

### BLOCK 8: REFLECTIONS & LEARNINGS

**Headline**: What I Learned Pioneering AI-Enabled Design at Enterprise Scale

**Content**:

**Key Learnings**:

**1. AI as Collaborative Partner, Not Replacement**
The most successful workshops positioned AI tools as thought partners that amplified human creativity rather than replaced it. Product Owners who understood their domain deeply produced better AI outputs—the tools enhanced their expertise, they didn't substitute for it.

**2. Governance Enables Velocity**
Establishing clear AI principles and quality frameworks upfront didn't slow innovation—it accelerated it. Teams moved confidently knowing guardrails existed, reducing hesitation and rework.

**3. Visual Storytelling Drives Adoption**
The "Art of the Possible" video series had greater organizational impact than written reports or presentations. Seeing the methodology in action built stakeholder confidence in ways documentation couldn't achieve.

**4. Design Thinking + AI = Multiplicative, Not Additive**
Integrating AI into structured design thinking processes created exponential improvements. AI synthesis of unstructured inputs, prompt engineering as ideation practice, and rapid prototyping as validation tool transformed each methodology phase.

**5. Change Management Requires Patience**
Not all stakeholders adopted AI methodologies at the same pace. Some teams needed multiple demonstrations and hands-on practice before feeling comfortable. Meeting people where they were—rather than forcing adoption—created sustainable change.

**What I'd Do Differently**:
- **Earlier Capability Uplift**: Launching Design Thinking training in month 1 rather than month 4 would have accelerated adoption
- **More Documentation**: Capturing workshop sessions on video for later analysis and training materials
- **Broader Pilot Projects**: Expanding "3 Concepts in 3 Weeks" across more business units simultaneously
- **Metrics Framework**: Establishing baseline metrics before starting to quantify improvement more rigorously

**What's Next**:
This work established foundational AI+UX capabilities at Greenstone. The methodologies, frameworks, and training materials are now organizational assets that will continue delivering value long after my tenure. I'm excited to apply these learnings at larger scale—helping enterprise organizations navigate AI adoption while maintaining human-centered design rigor.
