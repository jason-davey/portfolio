**Re: Product Owner (BBBH19639) - Confidential Client**

Dear AJ,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Product Owner role with your confidential financial services client. With 13+ years leading product delivery across banking, wealth management, and enterprise SaaS platforms - including supervising business analyst teams and collaborating directly with engineering squads in agile environments - I am confident I can deliver the practical, scalable, and high-quality outcomes your client requires.

## Why I'm an Excellent Fit for This Role

**Financial Services + Commerce Product Ownership**

My career has been built at the intersection of financial services and digital product delivery. At Westpac, I led product ownership for the Customer Service Hub transformation ($2B program, 500K+ customers), including the award-winning Westpac Wonder digital lending platform that achieved 35% improvement in loan application completion rates. At Security Bank Philippines, I spent 18 months delivering an enterprise customer service platform for 200+ contact center agents, managing the full product lifecycle from requirements gathering through production deployment.

Most recently, I led product delivery at ANZ Bank's Business Services Unit, where I collaborated with engineering squads to deliver an enterprise analytics platform that achieved 20% workflow efficiency improvements through data-driven feature prioritization and iterative optimization.

**Technical Background & Direct Engineering Collaboration**

My technical background bridges business analysis, solution architecture, and product delivery. I hold TOGAF v9.1 Enterprise Architecture certification and have deep experience creating technical specifications, user stories, and acceptance criteria that convert business requirements into engineering solutions. At British Telecommunications, I led product delivery for a global enterprise IT platform (2,000+ users across three regions), working directly with offshore development teams using agile methodology to deliver features that resulted in £270M in measured cost reduction.

I am comfortable operating hands-on with development teams in sprint planning, backlog refinement, and daily standups - translating stakeholder needs into technical requirements while understanding the constraints and opportunities of the underlying technology stack.

**Team Leadership & Business Analyst Supervision**

Throughout my career, I have directly supervised cross-functional delivery teams including business analysts, designers, QA specialists, and technical writers. At Security Bank, I supervised a team of 6 delivery specialists who reported directly to me, coordinating their work across requirements gathering, documentation, testing, and training. At Westpac, I led a team of 10+ across Sydney and Melbourne, establishing governance processes and quality standards that enabled consistent delivery across multiple product squads.

I excel at coaching teams on product thinking, facilitating productive stakeholder workshops, and building the analytical capabilities that enable teams to make data-driven decisions independently.

**Analytics-Driven Performance Optimization**

I am deeply analytical in my approach to product ownership. In every role, I have established metrics frameworks that connect product features to business outcomes - whether that's conversion rates, operational efficiency, cost reduction, or customer satisfaction. At Westpac Wonder, I implemented analytics tracking that enabled us to identify and resolve conversion bottlenecks, ultimately achieving 35% improvement in application completion. At ANZ, I defined workflow efficiency metrics that demonstrated measurable improvements in decision-making speed and strategic alignment.

I am experienced with Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, and custom dashboard creation, and I use data not just to track performance but to identify optimization opportunities and prioritize the backlog.

**Stakeholder Alignment in Complex Organizations**

Your role requires engaging with organizational stakeholders to drive alignment - an area where I have extensive experience. At Westpac, I managed stakeholder relationships across retail banking, risk, compliance, and technology divisions, building consensus across competing priorities. At BT, I established a Service Design Centre of Excellence that created governance frameworks adopted across the global organization. I am comfortable presenting to executives, facilitating cross-functional workshops, and building the relationships that enable smooth product delivery.

## Why This Role Interests Me

I am drawn to this opportunity because it combines three elements I find most rewarding: financial services domain expertise, hands-on collaboration with engineering teams, and the ability to supervise and mentor a business analyst team while delivering measurable business outcomes. The hybrid work arrangement (3 days office, 2 days WFH) aligns well with my preference for in-person collaboration balanced with focused delivery time.

While I am currently based in Mullumbimby, I am an Australian citizen and can relocate to Sydney immediately for the right permanent opportunity. My background working across Westpac, ANZ, and Security Bank has given me deep appreciation for the unique challenges of financial services product delivery - regulatory compliance, security requirements, legacy system integration, and the need for precision in high-stakes customer interactions.

## What I Bring to Your Client

Your client will gain a product owner who:

- **Delivers practical outcomes**: I focus on shipping features that solve real problems, not creating documentation for its own sake
- **Works hands-on with engineers**: I am comfortable in the weeds of sprint planning, story refinement, and technical tradeoff discussions
- **Uses analytics to drive decisions**: I establish metrics that matter and use them to prioritize and optimize
- **Builds and mentors teams**: I develop the capabilities of the people around me, creating sustainable delivery capacity
- **Understands financial services**: I know the regulatory, security, and customer sensitivity requirements that shape banking product decisions

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in financial services product delivery, technical collaboration, and team leadership can contribute to your client's success. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can provide references from previous product delivery engagements upon request.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Warm regards,

**Jason Davey**
