**Re: Senior UX Designer - 6 Month Contract**
Sydney, Hybrid | November/December 2025 Start

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

When clinicians, partners, and internal teams interact with enterprise systems, they shouldn't have to think about authentication flows, access permissions, or navigating between disconnected applications—they should be focused on their work. That's the standard I hold in designing enterprise experiences: invisible infrastructure that enables meaningful outcomes.

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior UX Designer role. With 13+ years designing complex enterprise platforms for banking, telecommunications, and healthcare environments, I bring the systems-level thinking, craft excellence, and stakeholder influence needed to shape experiences for clinicians, partners, and internal teams at global scale.

**Leading Systems-Level Design for Enterprise Impact**

At Westpac Banking Corporation, I led UX design for the Customer Service Hub—a $2B transformation program serving 500+ staff across four brands. I designed authentication flows, access management systems, and workflow experiences that unified operations across Westpac, St.George, Bank of Melbourne, and BankSA. This required establishing design systems, governance frameworks, and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0 AA) that enabled consistent, high-quality execution across multiple applications.

The award-winning Westpac Wonder platform (Good Design Australia, Asian Banker Excellence Awards) exemplifies my ability to balance craft and pragmatism—delivering beautiful, intuitive experiences while meeting complex compliance, security, and integration requirements.

**Partnering Across Engineering, Product, and Business**

At British Telecommunications, I led a 10-person design team delivering enterprise IT service platforms for 2,000+ staff globally. I established the Service Design Centre of Excellence, creating design documentation in Confluence, managing delivery through Jira, and partnering with engineering teams across UK, India, and Asia-Pacific. This program delivered £270M in cost savings through improved operational efficiency—demonstrating my ability to translate user needs into business outcomes.

More recently at ANZ Bank, I redesigned operational workflows for the Business Services Unit, achieving a 20% improvement in executive strategic decision-making efficiency. I facilitated alignment across diverse stakeholders, created experience frameworks in Figma, and ensured design intent through close collaboration with product and engineering teams.

**Design Governance, Craft Excellence, and Ways of Working**

Throughout my career, I've championed design quality while scaling practices across organizations. At Security Bank (Philippines), I led an 18-month customer contact framework redesign, establishing component libraries, conducting usability testing with 40+ contact center agents, and training 24 employees in human-centered design. At Vietcombank (Vietnam), I coached distributed teams on design governance, interaction design, and stakeholder communication—raising design maturity across the organization.

I hold a high craft bar, ensuring every solution is both functionally clear and visually refined. I'm proficient in Figma, experienced with Confluence and Jira for documentation and traceability, and skilled at creating design rationale that inspires alignment across technical and executive audiences.

**Why This Role**

This opportunity to shape authentication, access, and workflow experiences for clinicians and enterprise users aligns perfectly with my background designing mission-critical systems for complex organizations. I thrive in structured, evolving environments where governance, scale, and design maturity coexist—and I'm energized by the challenge of leaving behind systems that improve how thousands of professionals work daily.

I'm available for a November/December 2025 start and eager to relocate to Sydney for the contract duration. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience leading enterprise UX design can contribute to your team's success.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

**Jason Davey**
