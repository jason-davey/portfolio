### SLIDE 2: The Shift in AI Capabilities

**Script**:
"What's changed dramatically is the nature of AI itself. Early AI work involved narrow, task-specific applications—predictive analytics, chatbot decision trees, recommendation engines."

"Generative AI has transformed the landscape entirely. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and v0.dev aren't just automation—they're collaborative design partners that can synthesize complexity, generate functional prototypes, and accelerate innovation velocity by an order of magnitude. This shift required me to evolve from 'AI consumer' to 'AI orchestrator'—someone who understands how to integrate these tools into human-centered workflows while maintaining quality and ethical standards."

At Westpac (2015-2016), I led the Next Best Action AI program that increased customer engagement through personalized recommendations, demonstrating early adoption of machine learning for customer experience optimization.


Conversation Design enabled the Security Bank Philippines (2020) project to deliver a 24/7 chatbot reducing call centre volume by 42% while maintaining high customer satisfaction. The system handled over 10,000 daily interactions with natural language processing capabilities.



Service Design was the focus of the Service Bricks AI (2021) represented a breakthrough in AI-powered service design, helping teams with automated journey mapping and intelligent pattern recognition, reducing research time by 65% across client projects.


"But the real transformation happened in 2025 at Greenstone Financial Services, where I founded an AI+UX Innovation Practice that fundamentally changed how the organization approaches digital transformation.

Currently serving as Chief Design & Technology Officer at Insyteful Limited, scaling AI-enabled design methodologies across enterprise learning platforms and bringing innovation practices to new markets.
