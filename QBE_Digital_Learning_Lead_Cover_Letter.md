Dear QBE Insurance Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Digital Learning Lead position. With my unique combination of award-winning learning design expertise, cutting-edge AI implementation experience, and proven ability to translate complex concepts into engaging digital experiences, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to QBE's leadership development initiatives.

## Why I'm the Right Fit

**Digital Learning Innovation with AI Integration**

As Chief Design & Technical Officer at Insyteful, I am currently leading the development of AI-powered learning frameworks and competency assessment systems across APAC markets. My work focuses on:
- Building skills frameworks that leverage AI to personalize learning pathways
- Designing competency assessment tools that adapt to learner behaviors
- Creating microlearning modules using AI-assisted content generation
- Developing multi-modal learning experiences that combine traditional instructional design with emerging AI capabilities

This hands-on experience with AI in learning contexts directly addresses QBE's requirement for curiosity about emerging technologies and positions me to bring immediate value to your digital learning strategy.

**Award-Winning Learning Design Track Record**

During my tenure at Emergent Learning (2024-2025), I led strategic professional development programs for Fortune 500 clients that earned three prestigious LearnX Awards:
- Best Talented Team (Learning Design)
- Best HR Talent Management Initiative
- Best eLearning Project

These achievements demonstrate my ability to create behavior-change content that resonates with learners and delivers measurable outcomes—a core requirement for your Digital Learning Lead role.

**Translating Complexity into Accessible Learning**

At Greenstone Financial Services, I pioneered a Multi-Modal Design Framework that reduced concept-to-prototype delivery from weeks to 72 hours. This methodology excels at breaking down complex ideas into digestible, engaging formats across multiple learning modalities—exactly what QBE needs for leadership development content.

Key innovations include:
- Developed industry-first triple-AI collaborative system achieving 10x faster visual iteration
- Created AI-powered design automation achieving <2 minute design-to-code deployment
- Built executive dashboards reducing analysis time from hours to minutes

**Human-Centered Design & Design Thinking Expertise**

My 13+ years leading enterprise transformation projects have centered on human-centered design principles. Notable examples:
- **ANZ Bank**: Redesigned Business Services Unit with 20% efficiency improvement through design thinking workshops
- **Vietcombank**: Led 6-week digital operations training enhancing design thinking competencies for 50+ professionals
- **British Telecommunications**: Established Service Design Centre of Excellence delivering £270M cost savings

**Technical Proficiency & Creative Tools**

While my current focus is on strategic leadership and AI integration, I maintain hands-on expertise with creative and learning tools including:
- Figma and modern design tools (v0.dev, AI design assistants)
- Adobe Creative Suite (from my design background)
- Next.js/TypeScript for interactive learning experiences
- AWS Bedrock and Claude 3 for AI-powered content generation

I am actively engaged with tools like Articulate and Camtasia through my current learning design projects and am committed to continuous upskilling in the digital learning technology landscape.

## What I Bring to QBE

**Strategic Stakeholder Engagement**: Experience collaborating with C-suite executives across ANZ Bank, Westpac, and multinational organizations. Proven ability to influence senior leaders and translate business objectives into learning outcomes.

**Behavior Change Focus**: My portfolio demonstrates consistent success in creating content that drives measurable behavior change, from banking transformation programs to leadership development initiatives.

**Project Management Excellence**: Track record managing complex, multi-stakeholder projects with global teams, including 18-month frameworks and enterprise-wide transformation programs.

**Curiosity & Innovation Mindset**: As evidenced by my current role pioneering AI integration in learning design, I actively explore emerging technologies and experiment with new approaches to solve learning challenges.

## Why QBE & This Role

QBE's commitment to leadership development and investment in digital learning innovation strongly resonates with my professional mission. The opportunity to work on a dedicated leadership learning program, combined with the hybrid flexibility and wellbeing focus, makes this role particularly compelling. The fixed-term nature also appeals to me as it allows for focused, high-impact delivery within a defined timeframe.

I am based in Mullumbimby, NSW, and am fully prepared to work in a hybrid arrangement with regular travel to Brisbane or other QBE locations as needed.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique blend of learning design expertise, AI innovation, and enterprise transformation experience can contribute to QBE's leadership development goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Warm regards,

**Jason Davey**
