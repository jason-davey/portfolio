## Head of AI Engineering | Public Sector Organisation

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Head of AI Engineering role with your public-sector organisation. With 13+ years leading enterprise-wide AI-enabled transformation programs across Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and regulated financial institutions, I bring the strategic leadership, hands-on technical capability, and governance expertise required to responsibly operationalise AI at scale.

### Proven Track Record Delivering AI/ML Outcomes in Enterprise Settings

My experience leading technology transformation initiatives has consistently delivered measurable business impact:

- **$270M+ cost reduction** through digital transformation at British Telecommunications, establishing enterprise-wide Service Design Centres of Excellence
- **20% operational efficiency gains** at ANZ Bank through Business Services Unit redesign and process optimization
- **10x development acceleration** pioneering AI-enabled rapid prototyping methodologies compressing 3-month development cycles into 3-week sprints

At Westpac Banking Corporation, I established the **Next Best Action Program** framework working directly with Data & Growth teams on AI-driven customer intelligence systems—experience that gives me practical understanding of model deployment, data pipeline architecture, and production ML workflows in highly regulated environments.

### Hands-On Technical Leadership in AI Engineering & Architecture

As Head of Design at Greenstone Financial Services, I founded and led the **AI+UX Innovation Practice**, establishing:

- **Platform-agnostic AI governance frameworks** balancing innovation velocity with security, privacy-by-design, and regulatory compliance
- **TypeScript development standards** with AWS deployment configurations for production-ready AI-powered applications
- **Rapid prototyping pipelines** integrating generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, v0.dev) with enterprise technology stacks
- **Workshop-driven engineering practices** translating complex business requirements into functional prototypes through collaborative cross-functional sessions

My approach combines strategic architecture with hands-on execution—I've personally designed data integration patterns, authored deployment configurations, and diagnosed production issues across cloud-native and legacy-constrained environments.

### Strategic Leadership Across Legacy-Constrained & Regulated Environments

Throughout my career I've successfully navigated complex stakeholder landscapes and governance requirements:

- **TOGAF v9.1 Certified** with demonstrated ability to align AI/ML initiatives with enterprise architecture standards
- **Department of Defence Baseline Security Clearance (2024)** with experience managing privacy-by-design and compliance considerations
- **C-suite advisory experience** converting technical trade-offs into concise guidance for senior stakeholders across banking, telecommunications, and government sectors
- **Cross-functional leadership** partnering with product owners, compliance teams, ICT groups, and business units to ensure responsible, usable AI solutions

At British Telecommunications, I led a **10-member team** through complex governance checkpoints, progressing initiatives from prototype to production while meeting security, lifecycle, and regulatory requirements in a highly legacy-constrained environment.

### Capability Uplift & MLOps Practice Development

I've consistently elevated engineering capability across organisations:

- **Design Thinking curriculum development** integrating AI-powered ideation and prototyping tools for technology teams
- **Lunch & Learn series** improving AI literacy across Growth, Marketing, and Technology teams
- **Mentorship and coaching programs** for cross-functional teams adopting new methodologies
- **"Art of the Possible" workshop series** demonstrating AI capabilities to executive leadership and driving organizational adoption

My background in organizational learning design—recognized with **Diamond Winner, LearnX Awards (Best Blended Model & Talent Development)**—positions me to institutionalize DevOps/MLOps practices, automated testing, and operational monitoring across engineering teams.

### Why This Role

This position represents the ideal convergence of my technical AI engineering experience, strategic transformation leadership, and commitment to responsible AI deployment in mission-critical contexts. I'm particularly drawn to:

- **Meaningful impact**: Designing ethical, operational AI solutions that produce measurable benefits for public-sector users
- **Technical leadership**: Shaping architectural patterns that enable secure, repeatable AI rollouts across complex environments
- **Capability building**: Mentoring engineers and embedding modern engineering practices that institutionalize responsible AI
- **Governance excellence**: Operating under strict privacy obligations and regulatory frameworks that protect citizen interests

I bring pragmatic experience delivering results within resource-limited environments while maintaining uncompromising standards for security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. My track record demonstrates the ability to phase delivery into high-value increments that mitigate risk while unlocking longer-term change.

### Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience leading AI-enabled transformation programs, establishing governance frameworks, and building engineering capability can contribute to your organisation's responsible AI adoption journey.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring how I can support your mission-led digital programs.

Sincerely,

**Jason Davey**
