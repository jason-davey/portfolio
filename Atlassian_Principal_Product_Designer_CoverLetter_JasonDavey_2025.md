**RE: Principal Product Designer (REQ-2025-5723) – Software Collection, Administration, and Ecosystem Teams**

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Principal Product Designer role at Atlassian. As a long-time advocate and power user of Jira and Confluence across Fortune 500 organizations, I've experienced firsthand how these tools unleash the potential of teams. The opportunity to contribute to the future of software development, administration, and developer ecosystems—powered by AI and world-class UX—aligns perfectly with my 13+ years of experience designing complex enterprise platforms at scale.

## **Design Systems at Scale**

At Westpac, I unified design patterns across **4 brands** serving millions of customers, establishing a comprehensive design system and governance framework. At British Telecommunications, I led a 10-person design team to create reusable component libraries documented in Confluence, supporting a global enterprise IT platform serving **2,000+ technical users** and delivering **£270M in cost reduction**. At Security Bank, I built a design system from the ground up, managing a team of 6 designers and training 24 employees in design system governance.

## **Designing for Technical Users**

My experience designing for **2,000+ IT professionals** at British Telecommunications mirrors the complexity of Atlassian's developer ecosystem. I designed authentication, access management, and service workflow experiences, conducting extensive user research to translate complex needs into intuitive tools. This work required deep collaboration with engineering teams using **Jira for sprint planning** and **Confluence for design documentation**—tools I've used extensively across multiple organizations.

## **AI-Powered Innovation**

As Head of Design at Greenstone Financial Services, I founded an **AI+UX Innovation Practice** that pioneered the integration of generative AI with human-centered design. My **"3 Concepts in 3 Weeks"** initiative delivered **3 enterprise CRM prototypes in a 21-day sprint**, demonstrating **10x acceleration** in concept-to-prototype timelines. I developed AI governance frameworks for responsible, scalable AI adoption, and led collaborative workshops compressing 60-day discovery cycles into 90-minute sessions.

At Westpac, I designed the **Next Best Action program**, a predictive recommendation system for customer service representatives, partnering with data science and engineering teams to balance machine learning capabilities with UX needs.

## **Leadership & Measurable Impact**

I've built and scaled design teams of 10+ professionals, established Centers of Excellence, and won the LearnX Diamond Award for Best HR Talent Management. My work delivers measurable outcomes:

- **£270M cost reduction** (British Telecommunications)
- **$2B transformation program** design leadership (Westpac)
- **35% improvement** in completion rates and **50% reduction** in time-to-approval (Westpac Wonder)
- **20% efficiency gain** in operational workflows (ANZ Bank)

## **Why Atlassian?**

I've used Jira and Confluence throughout my career as both a practitioner and an advocate. This practitioner's perspective, combined with my design expertise, positions me to contribute meaningfully to Atlassian's mission. Whether working on Software Collection, Administration, or Ecosystem teams, my experience designing AI-powered products, enterprise platforms serving 500-2,000+ users, and design systems across multiple brands aligns with the complexity you're solving.

I'm drawn to Atlassian's culture of empowerment, autonomy, and impact. The opportunity to work with world-class designers, shape the future of team collaboration, and unleash potential at global scale is exactly the challenge I'm looking for at this stage of my career.

## **What I'll Bring**

Strategic design vision grounded in systems thinking, deep technical collaboration skills with engineering teams, leadership and mentorship excellence, AI innovation expertise with governance frameworks, measurable impact focus, and Atlassian tool fluency from a practitioner's perspective.

I'm based in Sydney and excited about the flexibility Atlassian offers. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Atlassian's vision and am happy to share case studies, portfolio work, or references.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of unleashing the potential of teams together.

Warmly,

**Jason Davey**
