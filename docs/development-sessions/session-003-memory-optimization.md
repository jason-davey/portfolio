# Session 003: Memory Optimization & Context Management

## Date: 2025-01-15

## Session Goals
- Optimize Kiro memory management for portfolio project
- Establish best practices for context retention
- Document memory solutions implemented

## Memory Solutions Implemented

### 1. Steering Files Created
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/project-context.md` - Core project context (always loaded)
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/development-workflow.md` - Technical workflow (manual)
- ✅ `.kiro/steering/content-strategy.md` - Content curation (file-matched)

### 2. Context Strategy
- **Automatic Context**: Core project info always available
- **Conditional Context**: Technical details when working on code
- **Manual Context**: Specific workflows when referenced with #development-workflow

### 3. Session Continuity
- Continue using same session for related work
- Document major decisions in session files
- Use steering files instead of re-explaining context

## Key Insights
- Steering files eliminate need to re-explain project context
- File-matched steering provides contextual guidance
- Session documentation creates searchable project history

## Next Actions
- Continue building portfolio features in this session
- Update steering files as project evolves
- Document major milestones in session files

## Status
Memory optimization complete ✅ - Kiro now has persistent project context
