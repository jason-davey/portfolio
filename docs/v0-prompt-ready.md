# Ready-to-Use v0.dev Prompt

## 🎯 Copy This Prompt to v0.dev:

```
Create an animated miniature planet portfolio interface with 5 distinct biomes that continuously rotate in a gentle circle, accompanied by a small animated guide character.

The planet should be an isometric 3D-styled sphere showcasing these career adventure paths:

🎯 Strategic Pathways → Northern Highlands with mountain peaks and observatory towers
🛠️ Build & Ship → Eastern Archipelago with harbors, lighthouses, and trade routes
🧠 Conceptual Horizons → Western Cloudlands with floating platforms and crystal formations
👥 Team Alchemy → Southern Valleys with villages, meeting circles, and collaboration bridges
🌱 Growth Catalyst → Central Forest Ring around equator with mentoring trees and coaching clearings

Include a small animated avatar character that can move around the planet, point to different regions, and serve as a visual guide. The character should match the miniature world's art style.

Features needed:
- Smooth planet rotation (15-30 second cycle)
- Hover anywhere on planet to pause rotation
- Click regions to explore (show placeholder interaction)
- Character animations: floating, pointing, gesturing
- Modern illustration style with distinct but harmonious colors for each biome
- Mobile-responsive design
- Subtle lighting and depth effects

Tech stack: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion

Make it feel like a living, explorable world that showcases a design leader's career journey.
