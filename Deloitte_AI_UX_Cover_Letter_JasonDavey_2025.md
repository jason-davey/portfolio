Deloitte
Service Delivery Transformation
Millers Point, NSW

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the AI UX Transformation Consultant role within Deloitte's Service Delivery Transformation program. With 13+ years pioneering AI-enabled design methodologies and delivering enterprise-scale transformation programs, I bring precisely the blend of UX innovation, AI adoption expertise, and business transformation leadership that this role demands.

## Why This Role Excites Me

Deloitte's commitment to leveraging generative AI to elevate operational efficiency and practitioner experiences resonates deeply with my recent work establishing an AI+UX Innovation Practice at Greenstone Financial Services. The opportunity to scale these methodologies across Deloitte's consulting portfolio—helping clients navigate the intersection of AI capability and human-centered design—represents the exact career progression I'm seeking.

## Proven AI-Powered UX Transformation Leadership

My recent tenure as Head of Design at Greenstone Financial Services demonstrates the precise capabilities your role requires:

**Rapid AI-Enabled Prototyping at Scale**
I pioneered the "3 Concepts in 3 Weeks" initiative, compressing traditional 3-month development cycles into 21-day sprints using collaborative workshops integrated with generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, v0.dev). This methodology delivered three enterprise-grade CRM prototypes—demonstrating a 10x acceleration in concept-to-functional-prototype timelines while maintaining production-ready quality standards.

**Workshop Facilitation Translating Complexity into Clarity**
In the Project EV2 initiative, I facilitated 90-minute workshops with Product Owners that transformed complex business requirements into visual, functional prototypes within a single session. Using a structured approach—discovery → synthesis (Miro AI) → prompt engineering (ChatGPT) → prototype generation (v0.dev)—we produced an enterprise CRM interface with four fully-articulated functional modules in just 10 minutes of active AI interaction. This work exemplifies my ability to navigate ambiguity in fast-paced environments while delivering tangible stakeholder value.

**Innovation Practice Establishment & Governance**
I founded Greenstone's AI+UX Innovation Practice, developing platform-agnostic AI principles, governance frameworks, and TypeScript-based development standards configured for AWS production deployment. This work positioned the organization to adopt AI responsibly while accelerating innovation velocity—directly aligning with Deloitte's need for consultants who can champion design best practices while maintaining quality standards.

## Enterprise Transformation Track Record

Beyond AI innovation, my career demonstrates sustained impact across Fortune 500 transformation programs:

- **£270M Cost Savings**: Led British Telecommunications' Service Design Centre of Excellence establishment, delivering enterprise-wide design methodology implementation
- **$2B Program Leadership**: Served as Head of Design for Westpac's Customer Service Hub transformation, leading 10+ designers through multi-brand platform integration
- **20% Efficiency Gains**: Redesigned ANZ Bank's Business Services Unit operational structure, improving decision-making speed through stakeholder-centered process optimization

## Design Thinking & Human-Centered Design Expertise

My Design Thinking curriculum development for Greenstone's technology teams demonstrates my capability to uplift organizational design maturity. I've architected comprehensive training frameworks integrating traditional human-centered design with AI-augmented innovation practices—bridging the gap between established methodologies and emerging AI capabilities.

## Portfolio & Case Study Evidence

My portfolio (jasdavey.myportfolio.com) showcases award-winning work including:
- Westpac Wonder loan origination platform (Australian Retail Banking Awards Winner, 2016)
- Multi-brand banking experience design (Asian Banker Excellence Award, 2016)
- Enterprise transformation case studies across telecommunications, banking, and insurance sectors

I am currently developing a comprehensive case study documenting the Greenstone AI+UX Innovation Practice establishment—including methodology frameworks, workshop facilitation approaches, and measurable business impact—which will provide concrete evidence of my AI transformation capabilities.

## Why Deloitte, Why Now

Deloitte's Service Delivery Transformation program represents the ideal environment to scale my AI-enabled UX methodologies across diverse client engagements. The opportunity to work with cross-functional stakeholders, engineers, and data scientists while championing design best practices aligns perfectly with my collaborative leadership style and passion for elevating practitioner experiences.

Having recently established foundational AI innovation practices at Greenstone, I'm eager to apply these learnings at enterprise consulting scale—helping Deloitte's clients navigate the complexities of AI adoption while maintaining human-centered design rigor.
