**Re: Senior Product Designer - Leading SaaS Organisation**
Brisbane, Hybrid | Permanent Role

---

Dear Rob and Just Digital People team,

Building a consumer portal that integrates new and existing products isn't just a design challenge—it's an opportunity to shape how customers experience your entire SaaS ecosystem. That's the kind of systems-level product thinking I bring: the ability to design end-to-end experiences from discovery through delivery while establishing the governance and metrics that ensure sustainable product quality.

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Product Designer role. With 13+ years leading product design across financial services, telecommunications, and healthcare SaaS platforms, I bring the discovery-to-delivery ownership, B2C design expertise, and stakeholder influence needed to create consumer experiences that scale.

**Leading End-to-End Product Design (Discovery → Delivery)**

At Westpac Banking Corporation, I led product design for Westpac Wonder—an award-winning consumer lending platform serving 500K+ customers. I directed discovery research with 30+ brokers and consumers to define product requirements, designed and prototyped the complete customer journey in Figma, and established UX metrics tracking application completion rates and customer satisfaction (NPS). Through iterative usability testing and agile collaboration with engineering teams, we achieved a 35% improvement in loan completion rates and 50% reduction in time-to-approval.

The platform won Good Design Australia, Asian Banker Excellence, and Australian Retail Banking Awards (2016)—demonstrating my ability to balance craft excellence with measurable business impact.

At ANZ Bank, I led discovery research, created prototypes, and partnered with product and engineering teams to deliver workflow improvements achieving 20% efficiency gains. I established UX performance metrics tracking decision-making speed and documented design requirements in Confluence for cross-functional alignment.

**Designing B2C Experiences with Systems Thinking**

While much of my recent work has been in B2B enterprise platforms, my foundation is in consumer-facing digital products. At Tourism Australia, I led UX strategy for Australia.com across six global consumer markets, conducting discovery research, creating personas and journey maps, and designing multi-language consumer experiences. I defined engagement metrics, conversion tracking, and content effectiveness measures—connecting user behavior to business outcomes.

More recently at Security Bank (Philippines), I led an 18-month product design engagement for a customer contact platform. I conducted research with 40+ contact center agents, documented customer insights, and established component libraries and governance frameworks. I defined and tracked UX metrics including task completion rates, time-to-resolution, and satisfaction scores—demonstrating my commitment to data-driven product decisions.

**Establishing Governance, Metrics, and Reusable Systems**

At British Telecommunications, I led a 10-person design team delivering enterprise SaaS platform design for 2,000+ global users. I established the Service Design Centre of Excellence, created design governance documentation in Confluence, built reusable component libraries, and defined UX performance metrics tracking task completion and user satisfaction. This program delivered £270M in cost savings through measurable operational efficiency improvements.

Throughout my career, I've championed design systems and governance frameworks that enable consistent product quality. At Westpac, I unified consumer experiences across four brands (Westpac, St.George, Bank of Melbourne, BankSA), establishing design systems, accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0 AA), and quality metrics that scaled across the organization.

**Figma Expertise, Prototyping, and Stakeholder Collaboration**

I'm a Figma expert with extensive prototyping experience—from low-fidelity concepts in discovery through high-fidelity interactive flows for engineering handoff. I use Confluence and Jira for design documentation and project tracking, ensuring traceability and alignment across product, engineering, and business stakeholders.

I've presented design rationale to executive audiences, facilitated workshops with cross-functional teams, and built consensus across diverse stakeholder groups throughout my career. At Vietcombank (Vietnam), I coached distributed product and design teams on governance, prototyping, and stakeholder communication—raising design maturity across the organization.

**Why This Role**

The opportunity to lead product design for a new consumer portal from discovery through delivery—integrating AI tools, defining governance processes, and establishing UX metrics—aligns perfectly with my background building scalable SaaS experiences. I thrive in environments where craft excellence meets systems thinking, and I'm energized by the challenge of shaping products that serve real customer needs while establishing the frameworks that ensure sustainable quality.

I'm available for an immediate or November 2025 start and eager to relocate to Brisbane for this permanent opportunity. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my end-to-end product design experience can contribute to your SaaS organization's success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to share my portfolio and discuss this role further.

Sincerely,

**Jason Davey**
